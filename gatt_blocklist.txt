# Firmware update services that don't check the update's signature
# present a risk of devices' software being modified by malicious web
# pages. Users may connect to a device believing they are enabling
# only simple interaction or that they're interacting with the
# device's manufacturer, but the site might instead persistently
# compromise the device.
